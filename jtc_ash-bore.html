<h2>Emerald Ash Bore</h2>
<br>
<h2>About The Ash Bore</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The emerald ash borer is a small green beetle that came to the United States from Asia.</li>
  <li>They bore holes in ash trees and show almost no sign of stopping.</li>
  <li>They are a particular threat to cities, where many ash trees were planted to replace the American elms killed by Dutch elm disease.</li>
  <li>Trees that are suffering from the emerald ash borer have a dying upper canopy, new growth at the bottom, D-shaped holes in the trunk and increased woodpecker activity.</li>
  <li>After a few months of infestation, affected ash trees are not safe to climb and will need to be removed or treated right away.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Dangers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The American chestnut tree suffered tremendous losses during the 1900s due to a fungus infestation that rapidly spread throughout the country.</li>
  <li>A whopping 4 billion American chestnuts, or 25% of the total hardwood tree population in the country, were lost as a result of the invasive fungus.</li>
  <li>The same thing happened to American elms in the mid-20th century as a result of a small beetle that spread Dutch elm disease.</li>
</ul>
